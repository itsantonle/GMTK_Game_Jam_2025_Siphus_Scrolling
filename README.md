##  About Siphus Rolling
The theme this year was **Loop!**
A A stubborn push.  Push, stumble, and strain against the weight of your worldâ€”where every effort reveals a piece of your characterâ€™s story. With dynamic UI, expressive animations, and a hauntingly subtle soundscape, this short experience invites players to feel each moment of resilience.

â€‹This was released for the GMTK Game Jam but is still a pretty much long work in progress â€‹. Nevertheless, being able to do much art for this game and coding some was a great experience
